# CUSAT Matchmaking

## About

CUSAT Matchmaking is a web application designed to facilitate anonymous matchmaking among students at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT), particularly aimed at celebrating Valentine's Day. 

## Overview

This project aims to provide a platform where CUSAT students can anonymously submit their information, including their name, gender, branch, year, and Instagram ID. The platform then uses this information to match users with potential crushes within the university based on certain criteria, such as opposite genders. 

## How It Works

Students interested in finding a potential match can fill out a simple form on the website, providing basic details about themselves. Once submitted, the platform anonymously matches them with another user based on specified criteria. If a match is found, users are notified about their match without revealing the identity of the other person. This adds an element of excitement and anticipation to the matchmaking process.

## Purpose

The purpose of CUSAT Matchmaking is to create a fun and engaging experience for students during Valentine's Day, allowing them to explore potential connections within their university community in a light-hearted and anonymous manner. It encourages interaction and connection among students while respecting their privacy and anonymity.

## Technologies Used

- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend of the application.
- Firebase: Utilized for storing user information and managing real-time data.
- HTML/CSS: Frontend development for creating user interfaces and styling the website.
